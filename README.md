# Optimization-Project-

This Project focuses on the application what you learn in the course to your self-formulated problems.
The problem that we discuss in this project is the famous "Diet Problem", this problem was formed based on these requirements.

## Requirments
1- Formulate the Optimization problem.
1.1- At least 4 variables
1.2- At least 1 nonlinear equation
1.3- One or more constraints

2- Solve the formulated problem
2.1- Apply atleast two solvers from three (fmincon, GA, or OASIS) to solve the problem 

3- Analyze and justify the results
